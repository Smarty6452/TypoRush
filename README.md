**Brainstorming and project overview:**

The project was developed in collaboration for all pages, such that each team member had the entire application in mind. This way, we ensured consistency in design and functionality across all screens. This prevented the risk of individual team members working independently for single page, which could have resulted in style inconsistencies and integration problems later such as different css styles for different pages (working in each page is a good thing too but we wanted a application that is kind of an actual catch instead of a simple group project!!). The aim was to maintain a consistent flow and a common visual style throughout the entire application. The project showed excellent collaboration and allowed us to have a clear vision of the end result from the beginning.

We began with requirement gathering and researching existing apps and design trends to keep our product dynamic and up-to-date. A key feature we desired was a leaderboard where users could view their scores and track their progress in typing speed.
